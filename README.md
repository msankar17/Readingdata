==================================================================
The process for reading/cleansing and creating a tidy data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
	- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
	- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set which containts measurements for each feature/variable.
	- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.The name of measurements which should be assigned to column headers for easier reading
	- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set which containts measurements for each feature/variable.
	- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.The name of measurements which should be assigned to column headers for easier reading
	- 'codebook.md': Explains all activities performed in this tidy data creation process
	- 'runAnalysis.R': The script which should be run to get the tidy data as output
	- 'TidyData.csv': The output file which has tidy data for each feature aggreated on subject,Activity
	- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

Reproducing the result:
======================
The codebook.md file has steps to recreate the steps and following them in the same order would give the output tidy data
